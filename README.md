Intro
</h3>
<p>
This is a project to hold all the code that I have been developing for the Guru, an in-house search utility at Quicken Loans powered by the Google Search Appliance (GSA).
</p>
<p>
The frontend xslt files are modified from the default frontend provided by the GSA. These are used in formatting search results and adding elements to the results page to improve the user experience.

<p>
Other code contained in this project are scripts that I have used in order to complete various tasks such as formatting documents that were necessary for configuring the GSA
